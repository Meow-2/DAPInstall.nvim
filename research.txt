The idea of this plugin is for it to manage debuggers for several programming lenguages that nvim-dap supports. The plugin must be able to:

	1. Install debuggers
	2. Uninstall debuggers
	3. List debuggers (?)


For that it will have these commands:

	1. DIInstall <debugger>
	2. DIUninstall <debugger>
	3. DIList



Things to evaluate:
	+ Since there is no way to "grab default configs", there should be a directory that holds all the configs.
	+ There should be list with the available debuggers
	+ There should be a setup() func to load the configs for each server
		+,i0 Setup will check if the config dir exists, else create it
	+ There should be a config({}) func to configure stuff for any given server
		+,i1 Config will configure a debugger
